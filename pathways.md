# Purposeful Pathways (Spring '24)

During the semester, you **must attend two events** that are designated as **Purposeful Pathways** events for Computer Science.

A list of such events will be provided to you, and you may ask for approval of additional events not on the list.

You are required to write a **1-2 page reflection on each event**.

Each reflection must include:

* Key insights from the event
* What you learned about yourself
* How you will apply what you learned

<hr/>

**_If you declared your major after August 1, 2023_**, then, as a **graduation requirement for Computer Science or Information Technology**, you are required to attend at least **two events from each of the three categories**:

1. Career Exploration
2. Professional Preparation
3. Networking & Employer Engagement

_AND_

Required to attend and reflect upon two activities for each of the following courses:
* All 300-level electives (CSC-332 and CSC-348 this semester)
* CSC-475 or CSC-502
* CSC-122

Implementation of this requirement will be through standardized, graded requirements in individual courses. 

This will allow **IT majors will ultimately participate in a minimum of six activities**, while **CS majors will ultimately participate in 10**, during their time at Furman.
