## Academic Integrity

<br/>


Academic Integrity standards are important to our Furman community and will be upheld in this class. Students should review the Academic Integrity Pledge posted in the classroom and resources available on [www.furman.edu/integrity](www.furman.edu/integrity). In this class, the grade penalty for an academic integrity violation is an F for the course. Academic Discipline procedures will be followed through the Office of the Academic Dean.

## AI assistants 

Strictly, for the code, in this course, you are allowed to use OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard or Github's CoPilot. 

However, you must 

a) Acknowledge the use of these tools in your report

b) NOT USE ChatGPT or Bard or CoPilot for the reflections, posters, presentations and final report of the course.
