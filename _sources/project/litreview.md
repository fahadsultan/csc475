# Literature Review 

```{important}
Literature Review is due on **February 20th** at 2:30 PM. 
```

For the next phase of the project, you are to conduct a literature review for your proposed project. Add a "Literature Review" section to the same Overleaf project as your Project Proposal.

The literature review should include **a minimum of 10 new citations of relevant sources. The majority of the sources should be peer-reviewed conference or journal articles**. The citations in the literature review should should reflect the state of the art existing work in the area of your project.

The literature review section **should read as a narrative**: starting with a broad overview of the area of your project, narrowing down to the specific problem you are trying to solve and concluding with how your work adds to the body of existing work. Failure to cite any seminal work in the area of your project will result in a significant deduction of points. 

The presentation by **[Ms. Diaz](https://www.furman.edu/people/allison-diaz/)**, as well as the **[library course guide](https://libguides.furman.edu/c.php?g=1343703&p=9909151)**, should serve as useful guides for how to search for relevant literature. For reference, her presentation and handouts can be accessed using the following links: **[Handout 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fahadsultan/seminar-in-cs/b30e6c11a4faf5e4aa4dab701c5596ba61aa44b6/assets/Scientific_Sources_Best_Use_Preprints_and_IMRaD__HandO.pdf)**, **[Handout 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fahadsultan/seminar-in-cs/b30e6c11a4faf5e4aa4dab701c5596ba61aa44b6/assets/DYRT_5Ws_Boolean%20Handout.pdf)** and **[Slides](https://github.com/fahadsultan/seminar-in-cs/raw/b30e6c11a4faf5e4aa4dab701c5596ba61aa44b6/assets/Finding%20Sources-%20CSC%20475%20-%20Sultan.pptx)**. 

Please feel free to reach out to Ms. Diaz for assistance on finding relevant articles. 

To add to the great resources shared by Ms. Diaz, let me add the following:

1. **[DBLP](https://dblp.org/)** is the most comprehensive database of specifically computer science literature. It is a great place to start your search. Make sure to try search terms relevant to your project.


2. **[ACM Computing Surveys](https://dl.acm.org/journal/csur)** is a journal that publishes only survey articles. Survey articles are essentially all literature review with no new reported research results.


3. **[Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/)** is a great blog that reports on retractions of published articles. Use their **[database](http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?)** to find out if an article you are considering citing has been retracted. 


4. **[Beall's List](https://beallslist.net/)** is a list of (potentially) predatory journals. It is a great place to find out if a journal you are considering citing is (potentially) predatory.


Please reach out to me or Ms. Diaz if you have any questions or need help with your literature review.
