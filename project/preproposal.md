# Pre-Proposal

1. Create accounts on **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)** and **[Github](https://github.com/)** and share your account information. 

2. Identify 3 potential project ideas for your CSC-475 Project. Describe each idea in 250 words or more. 

    Unless you feel completely certain about a specific topic, I strongly encourage you to suggest ideas that are widely varied and diverse. 

    In the proposal phase, donâ€™t let feasibility factor into your ideas. Think big and broad (for now). 

    Some factors that you should consider are: 

    * It should be aligned with your personal interests (goes without saying). 

    * It should ideally be aligned with your chosen major(s)/minor(s)/cognate discipline. 

    * It should ideally be aligned with your future career goals. Something you would be proud to bring up and discuss in interviews and applications. 

    * Are there any interesting publicly available datasets that could be used for the project?
	
    Please note that none of the considerations above are binding or mandatory, except for the first.  

Based on our conversations in class, your pre-course survey responses and my own interests and areas of expertise, I will also put together a list of ideas that will share by the deadline. 

Please also note that this is not the _final_ project proposal. However, the final project proposal (due a week later, as indicated on the course website) is likely to be one of the three ideas you propose here or at least closely related.
