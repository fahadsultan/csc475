    "\n",
    "LaTeX (pronounced “LAY-tek” or “LAH-tek”) is a tool for _typesetting_ professional-looking documents. LaTeX’s mode of operation is quite different from word processors such as Microsoft Word. A LaTeX document is a plain text file interspersed with LaTeX _commands_ used to express the desired (typeset) results. \n",

    "`````{admonition} Typeface vs. Font\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "A _typeface_ is the underlying visual design that can exist in many different _typesetting_ technologies, and a _font_ is one of these implementations. In other words, a typeface is what you see and a font is what you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "_A font is to typeface what an mp3 file is to a song_. \n",
    "`````\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce a visible, typeset document, your LaTeX file is processed by a piece of software called a TeX engine which uses the commands embedded in your text file to guide and control the typesetting process, converting the LaTeX commands and document text into a professionally typeset PDF file. This means you only need to focus on the content of your document and the computer, via LaTeX commands and the TeX engine, will take care of the visual appearance (formatting).\n",

LaTeX is an extension of TeX, written by [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) in the 1980s. \n",
    "\n",
    "LaTeX markup is widely used in academic circles for publishing papers and books. The strange casing of letters in the name LaTeX was originally to distinguish it from now defunct softwares such as [TEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Executive_Programming_Language).\n",

    "You can see that LaTeX has automatically indented the first line of the paragraph, taking care of that formatting for you. Let’s have a closer look at what each part of our code does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of code, `\\documentclass{article}`, declares the document type known as its class, which controls the overall appearance of the document. Different types of documents require different classes; i.e., a CV/resume will require a different class than a scientific paper which might use the standard LaTeX article class. Other types of documents you may be working on may require different classes such as book or report. To get some idea of the many LaTeX class types available, visit the relevant page on CTAN (Comprehensive TeX Archive Network).\n",
    "\n",
    "Having set the document class, our content, known as the body of the document, is written between the `\\begin{document}` and `\\end{document}` tags. After opening the example above, you can make changes to the text and, when finished, view the resulting typeset PDF by recompiling the document. To do this in Overleaf, simply select the green Recompile button. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any Overleaf project can be configured to recompile automatically each time it is edited: click the small arrow next to the Recompile button and set Auto Compile to On, as shown in the following screengrab:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a blank project on Overleaf, the LaTeX document is stored as a file called main.tex: the .tex file extension is, by convention, used when naming files containing your document’s LaTeX code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example showed how document content was entered after the `\\begin{document}` command; however, everything in your `.tex` file appearing _before_ that point is called the _preamble_, which acts as the document’s “setup” section. Within the preamble you define the document class (type) together with specifics such as languages to be used when writing the document; loading _packages_ you would like to use (more on this later), and it is where you’d apply other types of configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimal document preamble might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code} latex\n",
    "\\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}\n",
    "\\usepackage{graphicx}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `\\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}` defines the overall class (type) of document. Additional parameters, which must be separated by commas, are included in square brackets (`[...]`) and used to configure this instance of the article class; i.e., settings we wish to use for this particular `article`-class-based document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the two parameters do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 12pt sets the font size\n",
    "* letterpaper sets the paper size\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course other font sizes, 9pt, 11pt, 12pt, can be used, but if none is specified, the default size is 10pt. As for the paper size, other possible values are `a4paper` and `legalpaper`. For further information see the article about page size and margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preamble line\n",
    "\n",
    "`\\usepackage{graphicx}`\n",
    "\n",
    "is an example of loading an external package (here, [`graphicx`](https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx?lang=en)) to extend LaTeX’s capabilities, enabling it to import external graphics files. LaTeX packages are discussed in the section Finding and using LaTeX packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Title, Author and Date\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a title, author and date to our document requires three more lines in the _preamble_ (not the main body of the document). Those lines are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\\title{My first LaTeX document}`: the document title\n",
    "* `\\author{Hubert Farnsworth}`: here you write the name of the author(s) and, optionally, the `\\thanks` command within the curly braces:\n",
    "  * `\\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}`: can be added after the name of the author, inside the braces of the author command. It will add a superscript and a footnote with the text inside the braces. Useful if you need to thank an institution in your article.\n",
    "* `\\date{August 2022}`: you can enter the date manually or use the command `\\today` to typeset the current date every time the document is compiled\n",
    "\n",
    "With these lines added, your preamble should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} latex\n",
    "\\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}\n",
    "\\title{My first LaTeX document}\n",
    "\\author{Hubert Farnsworth\\thanks{Funded by the Overleaf team.}}\n",
    "\\date{August 2022}\n",

    "With the abstract in place, we can begin writing our first paragraph. The next example demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* how a new paragraph is created by pressing the \"enter\" key twice, ending the current line and inserting a subsequent blank line;\n",
    "\n",
    "* how to start a new line without starting a new paragraph by inserting a manual line break using the \\\\ command, which is a double backslash; alternatively, use the `\\newline` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third paragraph in this example demonstrates use of the commands `\\\\` and `\\newline`:\n",

    "\n",
    "This line will start a second paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start the third paragraph and then add \\\\ a manual line break which causes this text to start on a new line but remains part of the same paragraph. Alternatively, I can use the \\verb|\\newline|\\newline command to start a new line, which is also part of the same paragraph.\n",

    "New users are advised that multiple `\\\\` or `\\newlines` should not used to “simulate” paragraphs with larger spacing between them because this can interfere with LaTeX's typesetting algorithms. The recommended method is to continue using blank lines for creating new paragraphs, without any `\\\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chapters and sections\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer documents, irrespective of authoring software, are usually partitioned into parts, chapters, sections, subsections and so forth. LaTeX also provides document-structuring commands but the available commands, and their implementations (what they do), can depend on the document class being used. By way of example, documents created using the book class can be split into parts, chapters, sections, subsections and so forth but the letter class does not provide (support) any commands to do that.\n",

The numbering of sections, subsections etc. is automatic but can be disabled by using the so-called _starred version_ of the appropriate command which has an asterisk (*) at the end, such as `\\section*{...}` and `\\subsection*{...}`.\n",

    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "LaTeX is a form of “program code”, but one which specializes in document typesetting; consequently, as with code written in any other programming language, it can be very useful to include comments within your document. A LaTeX comment is a section of text that will not be typeset or affect the document in any way—often used to add “to do” notes; include explanatory notes; provide in-line explanations of tricky macros or comment-out lines/sections of LaTeX code when debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a comment in LaTeX, simply write a `%` symbol at the beginning of the line, as shown in the following code which uses the example above:\n",

    "% This line here is a comment. It will not be typeset in the document.\n",
    "\\end{document}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example produces output that is identical to the previous LaTeX code which did not contain the comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bold, italics and underlining\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will now look at some text formatting commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bold**: bold text in LaTeX is typeset using the `\\textbf{...}` command.\n",
    "* _Italics_: italicised text is produced using the `\\textit{...}` command.\n",

    "\n",
    "``` {code-block} latex\n",
    "Some of the `\\textbf{greatest}`\n",
    "discoveries in \\underline{science} \n",
    "were made by \\textbf{\\textit{accident}}.\n",

You need to make sure that the sum of the widths you specify for the subfigures is less than the text width if you want them all on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we add the image in we need to specify the width using `width=` followed by the `\\textwidth` command. The reason this works is because the text width within the subfigure is the width we specified in the `\\begin{subfigure}` command, i.e. 0.3 times the normal text width (which is the value of `\\textwidth`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we give the subfigure a separate caption and label. We can then end the subfigure and add the next two in. To add some spacing between the figures we'll use the `\\hfill` command. If you didn't want them all on the same line you could just leave blank lines instead of the `\\hfill` commands. Please note that the indents I have used do not affect the how the code is processed, they just make it more readable. The beauty of these subfigures is that we can refer to each of them individually in the text due to their individual labels—but we can also give the whole figure a caption and label.\n",
