# Proposal 

```{note}
You can access the **[Overleaf template here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qqktkgdpbkkx#fae525)**.
```

The project proposal must meet the following three requirements:  

1. You must use $\LaTeX$ to typeset your proposal. Use [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qqktkgdpbkkx#fae525).
2. At least one page, _excluding_ references. 
3. You must have at least 2 citations. These could be URLs. See [here](https://fahadsultan.com/csc475/tutorials/latex.html#citing-a-url) for how to cite URLs in $\LaTeX$. 

Some key information to include:

## Project Title.

Come up with a good title for your project.

## Author Information.

Include your name and email address in the author description above.

## Background

Set the scene for the project. 
What problems are you attempting to solve, or what knowledge are you hoping to discover?
What motivations and problems make this work important? 
Include statistics related to the problem to argue why the problem needs attention and cite their source(s) e.g. "Dietary increase in glucose consumption over the past 100 years has led to a national epidemic of type 2 diabetes" {cite:p}`dabelea2014prevalence` 

## Goal

State your proposed solution to the problem. I 
Briefly motivate why you chose this goal -- why do you think it is important, interesting, challenging and/or likely to succeed?
If you have any secondary or stretch goals (i.e. things you will do if you have time), please also describe them. Describe the task clearly -- give an example of an input and an output, if applicable.

## Data

Specify the dataset(s) you will use and cite their source. Describe briefly the provenance of the data: who collected it and made it available? How frequently? 
If you plan to collect your own data, describe how you will do that and how long you expect it to take.

## Methods

Describe the techniques you plan to use. 
If you plan to explore a variant of an existing method or tool/software, focus on describing how your method will be different.
Make it clear what are some key components of your proposed solution and how do you plan to implement them.
If there is any part of your planned method that is original, make it clear. 

## Evaluation
If applicable, describe how you might quantitatively or qualitatively evaluate your project to assess the project's success. 

## Dissemination

Specify how you are going to disseminate your project. Would the final software and/or its code be publicly available to everyone? If so, how? Would you be willing to make your final report public on a preprint server such as arXiv. In addition to the course presentation and poster presentation, would you live demo your project on a computer at Furman Engaged?
